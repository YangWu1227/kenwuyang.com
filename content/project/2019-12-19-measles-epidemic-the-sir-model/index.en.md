&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This report was written for my undergraduate [Calculus II](https://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-and-majors/mathematics-statistics/academic-program-requirements/courses-in-mathematics/) class. The mock-scenario involves a measles outbreak on an isolated island with 50,000 inhabitants. To help monitor the situation, I employed a naive epidemiological model to provide estimations for the rate of transmission under various conditions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I implemented the model *naively* by making three simplifying, but not necessarily implausible assumptions:

* No mortality rate
* Permanent immunity once recovered
* Short time horizon in which there is no need to consider immigration and emigration

Other diseases may require a more complex model. The finished paper can be found {{< staticref "project/SIR model/Yang_Wu_Writing_Sample.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
