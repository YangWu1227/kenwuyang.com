In my first post, we will be implementing some interesting mathematical objects in R. 

Why? Why not? It's a good way to practice solving problems in R.

## The Binomial Theorem

\begin{align*}
    (x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}x^{k}y^{n-k}
\end{align*}

Expanding:

\begin{align*}
    (x+y)^n=\binom{n}{0}x^{0}y^{n-0}+\binom{n}{1}x^{1}y^{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}x^{2}y^{n-2}+... \\ +\binom{n}{n-1}x^{n-1}y^{n-(n-1)}+\binom{n}{n}x^{n}y^{n-n}
\end{align*}

In R, we can tackle the implementation of the Binomial Theorem in three parts:

* the binomial coefficient 
* raising the real number $x$ to the vector of powers $k$
* raising the real number $y$ to the vector of powers $n-k$

```{r}
binomial_theorem <- function(x, y, n) {

  # Create a sequence from k = 0 to k = n
  seq_k_n <- seq.int(from = 0, to = n, by = 1)


  # Pre-allocate container for storing coefficients
  binom_coeffs <- vector(mode = "double", length = n + 1)
  # Binomial coefficients
  binom_coeffs <- purrr::map_dbl(.x = seq_k_n, .f = choose, n = n)


  # Pre-allocate container for storing the x's
  vector_of_x <- vector(mode = "double", length = n + 1)
  # Raise x to the power of y
  vector_of_x <- x^(seq_k_n)


  # Pre-allocate container for storing the y's
  vector_of_y <- vector(mode = "double", length = n + 1)
  # Raise y to the power of n-k
  vector_of_y <- y^(n - (seq_k_n))


  # Product of the two vectors and their coefficients
  prod <- binom_coeffs * vector_of_x * vector_of_y

  # Summation operator
  result <- sum(prod)
  result
}
```

Let's see it in action:

```{r}
# Test
x <- 924
y <- 23
n <- 39
# Compute by hand
(x + y)^n
# Compute using custom function
binomial_theorem(x = x, y = y, n = n)
```

As can be seen, the results are exactly the same.

## Pascal's Triangle

Directly related to the Binomial coefficient is Pascal's triangle, whose entries in each row are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.

```{r, out.height="50%", out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
# Import image
knitr::include_graphics("Pascal's Triangle.png")
```

To implement Pascal's triangle, we will use a for loop. Our goal is to write a program that finds the next row of Pascal's triangle, given the previous rows.

```{r}
# Finding the (n + 1)th row of a Pascal's triangle given n rows that precede it
pascal_triangle_n_plus_1 <- function(x) {
  if (!is.list(x)) {
    rlang::abort(message = "The input object must a be a list containing the rows of Pascal's Triangle.")
  }

  # Set n equal to depth of the input list "x", that is, the number of elements in x, where each represents a row
  n <- length(x)
  # Extract the last element (the nth row) from the input list "x" and store it as a new variable x_n
  # Use [[ to extract the value rather than a sub-list
  x_n <- x[[n]]
  # Repeat the integer "1" (n + 1) times
  # Note that the (n + 1)th  row has (n + 1) elements beginning and ending with 1
  x_n_plus_1 <- rep(x = 1, times = n + 1)

  # Loop to add all adjacent pairs in the nth row to obtain the (n + 1)th row
  # Start with the second element and end with second to last element of each row
  # This is because the first and last numbers in any given row are always 1
  if (n > 1) {
    # This is the prefix form of for loop
    `for`(
      var = i,
      seq = 2:n,
      action = x_n_plus_1[[i]] <- x_n[[i - 1]] + x_n[[i]]
    )
  }

  # Append the (n + 1)th row to the list object
  base::append(x, values = list(x_n_plus_1))
}
```

---

Let's see it in action:

```{r}
# Create a Pascal's Triangle with 4 rows
x <- list(c(1), c(1, 1), c(1, 2, 1), c(1, 3, 3, 1))
# Row 5
x <- pascal_triangle_n_plus_1(x = x)
x[[5]]
# Row 6
x <- pascal_triangle_n_plus_1(x = x)
x[[6]]
# We know that these row entries can be computed are the binomial coefficients 5 choose 0 thru 5 choose 5
purrr::map2_dbl(
  .x = rep(x = 5, times = 6),
  .y = seq.int(from = 0, to = 5, by = 1),
  .f = choose
)
```

That's it for my first post! I'll update this post to include more interesting topics for my future self and perhaps others who may stumble across this. Peace!
