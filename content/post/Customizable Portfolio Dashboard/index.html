<p>       Shiny is a framework for creating web applications using R code. It’s server uses reactive programming, which allows for an interactive approach to communicating data analysis results. Shiny allows <em>you</em>, the users of the web applications, to interact with the data and the analyses, which the creator has put together in the back-end.</p>
<p>       In this application, I will create a customizable portfolio dashboard that will empower you to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Construct a portfolio by selecting assets and weights</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the investment horizon by selecting a start and an end date</p></li>
<li><p>Specify portfolio strategies— rebalancing frequency, risk-free rate, benchmark, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute measures of risk and return and other portfolio performance metrics</p></li>
<li><p>Visualize measures of risk and return and other portfolio performance metrics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of creating such a user-friendly portfolio dashboard is taken from <a href="http://www.reproduciblefinance.com/">Reproducible Finance with R</a>. I strongly recommend this book to those of you who may be interested in finance and are passionate about R like I am.</p>
