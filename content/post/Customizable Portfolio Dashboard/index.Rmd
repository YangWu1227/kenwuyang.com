&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shiny is a framework for creating web applications using R code. It's server uses reactive programming, which allows for an interactive approach to communicating data analysis results. Shiny allows *you*, the users of the web applications, to interact with the data and the analyses, which the creator has put together in the back-end. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this application, I will create a customizable portfolio dashboard that will empower you to accomplish the following:

* Construct a portfolio by selecting assets and weights

* Specify the investment horizon by selecting a start and an end date 

* Specify portfolio strategies--- rebalancing frequency, risk-free rate, benchmark, etc.

* Compute measures of risk and return and other portfolio performance metrics

* Visualize measures of risk and return and other portfolio performance metrics 

The idea of creating such a user-friendly portfolio dashboard is taken from [Reproducible Finance with R](http://www.reproduciblefinance.com/). I strongly recommend this book to those of you who may be interested in finance and are passionate about R like I am.
