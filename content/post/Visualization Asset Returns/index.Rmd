## Visualization Asset returns in xts

In this post, we will explore some visualizations of asset returns. Similar to the previous post, we import our data from Yahoo Finance. The five assets under examination are Exchange Traded Funds, which are funds that can be traded on an exchange like a stock. Exchange-traded funds are a type of investment fund that offers the best attributes of two popular assets: they have the diversification benefits of mutual funds and the ease with which stocks are traded.

```{r}
# Create a vector of ticker symbols
symbols <- c("SPY", "EFA", "DIA", "QQQ", "AGG")
# Load data from 2012 to today
prices <- quantmod::getSymbols(
  Symbols = symbols,
  src = "yahoo",
  from = "2012-12-31",
  to = "2021-7-31",
  auto.assign = TRUE,
  warnings = FALSE
) %>%
  # The map function takes an anonymous function and will return a list of five
  # The Ad() function extracts the adjusted price series for each ETF
  purrr::map(.f = ~ quantmod::Ad(get(x = .x))) %>%
  # Use reduce() to merge the elements of .x consecutively
  purrr::reduce(.f = merge) %>%
  # Use a replacement function to set column names as ticker symbols
  # This function is in prefix form
  # It is equivalent to colnames(x = prices) <- value
  `colnames<-`(value = symbols)
# Remove all objects but price series and ticker symbol vector
rm(list = setdiff(x = ls(), y = c("prices", "symbols")))
```

Since we will not be aggregating asset returns to compute portfolio returns, we choose log returns, i.e., the continuously compounded rate of returns, over the simple returns. Continuously compounded rate of returns should be used in statistical analysis (and visualizations) because unlike simple returns they are not positively biased. In addition, we opt to convert daily prices to monthly returns by finding the relative change of prices between the last day of each month. We could have easily chosen to use the first day of each month, and the values of the monthly returns will be different. 

```{r}
# Keep only the last price reading of each month
asset_returns_xts <- xts::to.monthly(
  x = prices,
  drop.time = TRUE,
  indexAt = "lastof",
  OHLC = FALSE
) %>%
  # Compute log returns
  PerformanceAnalytics::Return.calculate(method = "log") %>%
  # Drop the first row since we lose one observation in 12/31/2012
  stats::na.omit()
```


###  Monthly log returns highcharts

The `highcharter` package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/highcharter/highcharter.pdf) is a wrapper for the "Highcharts" Library, which has an amazing visualization infrastructure for time series and financial data. The `highcharter` package houses functions that accept xts objects (R's time series object class) as arguments, making it seamless to move from time series data to visualizations. The plot below displays the line chart for a subset of the ETF's. We could have easily plotted all five ETF's on the same line chart, but it would be harder for our eyes to compare, contrast, and identify patterns. 

```{r}
# Crate Highstock widget
highchart(type = "stock") %>%
  # Add chart main title
  hc_title(text = "Monthly Log Returns for SPY, QQQ, DIA") %>%
  # Add returns series to highchart objects
  # We use "symbols" to reference series since we may need to add/remove ETF's in the future
  # Use matrix sub-setting and character indexing to select returns by column
  hc_add_series(
    data = asset_returns_xts[, symbols[[1]]],
    name = symbols[[1]]
  ) %>%
  hc_add_series(
    data = asset_returns_xts[, symbols[[4]]],
    name = symbols[[4]]
  ) %>%
  hc_add_series(
    data = asset_returns_xts[, symbols[[3]]],
    name = symbols[[3]]
  ) %>%
  # Add theme to highchart object
  # More thems to be found in the vignette
  hc_add_theme(hc_thm = hc_theme_darkunica()) %>%
  # Navigator
  hc_navigator(enabled = TRUE) %>%
  # Scrollbar
  hc_scrollbar(enabled = TRUE) %>%
  # Exporting
  hc_exporting(enabled = TRUE) %>%
  # Add legend
  hc_legend(enabled = TRUE)
```

* The navigator is a small series below the main series, displaying a view of the entire data set. It provides tools to zoom in and out on parts of the data as well as panning across the dataset

* The scrollbar is a means of panning over the X axis of a stock chart. Scrollbars can also be applied to other types of axes.

### Monthly log returns Histograms

Create a function that returns a univariate histogram given a series of returns. The function will also take several other arguments--- an xts object of returns, a vector of ticker symbols, a symbol index, and a color for plotting. Internally, the function creates a list of histogram components: counts, density, bin breaks, etc. Then, the function `hchart()` is called on the histogram list object to plot the univariate histogram; this is the final output of the function. 

```{r}
hc_hist_fun <- function(xts_obj, tickers, symbol_index, color) {

  # Check for invalid input
  if (!is.xts(xts_obj) || !rlang::is_character(color) || !rlang::is_character(tickers)) {
    rlang::abort(
      message = "Invalid input type for xts_object, tickers, and/or color arguments"
    )
  }

  # Create histogram list object with 6 elements
  hc_hist <- graphics::hist(xts_obj[, tickers[[symbol_index]]],
    breaks = "Freedman-Diaconis",
    plot = FALSE
  )

  # Call hchart on the histogram list object
  hchart(object = hc_hist, color = color) %>%
    hc_title(
      text =
        paste(tickers[[symbol_index]], "Log Returns Distribution", sep = " ")
    ) %>%
    hc_add_theme(hc_thm = hc_theme_flat()) %>%
    hc_exporting(enabled = TRUE) %>%
    hc_legend(enabled = FALSE)
}
```

---

Now, we utilize the functional programming tool from `purrr` to interactively apply the function above to each of the univariate returns series.  

```{r}
# Map the histogram functionto each of the returns series
list_of_histogram <- purrr::map(
  .x = 1:5,
  .f = ~ hc_hist_fun(
    xts_obj = asset_returns_xts,
    tickers = symbols,
    symbol_index = .x,
    color = "cornflowerblue"
  )
)
list_of_histogram[[1]]
list_of_histogram[[2]]
list_of_histogram[[3]]
list_of_histogram[[4]]
list_of_histogram[[5]]
```

## Visualizations in the tidyvserse

Similarly, we can plot our asset returns using `ggplot2`, which implements the layered grammar of graphics approach. For efficiency, we will convert the xts object into the *long tidy* format that the tidyverse functions are designed to work well with. For another method of data importation, please see my other posts.

```{r,include=FALSE}
asset_returns_dplyr <- xts::to.monthly(
  x = prices,
  drop.time = TRUE,
  indexAt = "lastof",
  OHLC = FALSE
) %>%
  # Create a new "date" variable by extracting the date indices from the xts object
  base::data.frame("date" = zoo::index(x = .)) %>%
  # Coerce to tibble
  dplyr::as_tibble() %>%
  # Create a key column "asset" that contains the column names, i.e. ticker symbols
  # Create a value column that contains all the cells associated with each column
  # We convert to long format since it is easier to compute the returns using lag()
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = 1:5,
    names_to = "asset",
    values_to = "returns"
  ) %>%
  # Group by ticker symbol
  dplyr::group_by(asset) %>%
  # Compute log returns manually
  dplyr::mutate(
    "returns" = (
      log(x = returns, base = exp(1)) - log(x = dplyr::lag(x = returns), base = exp(1))
    )
  ) %>%
  # Remove NA_double_ readings for 12/31/2021
  na.omit()
# See the retults
head(asset_returns_dplyr, 5)
```

Here's the histogram; notice that we can overlay the histograms on top of each other or show them in separate panels. I recommend using the panel approach for studying the shapes of the univariate distributions, and employ the overlaying histograms for making comparisons between these distributions.

### Histogram

```{r, fig.height= 7, fig.width=7}
# Compute Freedman-Diaconis bin numbers
bins_fd <- function(vec) {
  diff(range(vec)) / (2 * IQR(vec) / length(vec)^(1 / 3))
}
# Histogram
ggplot(data = asset_returns_dplyr, mapping = aes(x = returns)) +
  geom_histogram(
    alpha = 0.5,
    mapping = aes(fill = asset),
    bins = bins_fd(asset_returns_dplyr[["returns"]])
  ) +
  ggtitle("Distributions of Monthly Log Returns") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey97"),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
  )
# Histogram with panels
ggplot(data = asset_returns_dplyr, mapping = aes(x = returns)) +
  geom_histogram(
    alpha = 0.5,
    mapping = aes(fill = asset),
    bins = bins_fd(asset_returns_dplyr[["returns"]])
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~asset) +
  ggtitle("Distributions of Monthly Log Returns") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey97"),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
  )
```

### Densty

```{r, fig.height= 7, fig.width=7}
# Density plot
ggplot(data = asset_returns_dplyr, mapping = aes(x = returns)) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(color = asset)) +
  ggtitle("Distributions of Monthly Log Returns") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey97"),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
  )
# Density plot with panels
ggplot(data = asset_returns_dplyr, mapping = aes(x = returns)) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(color = asset)) +
  geom_histogram(
    alpha = 0.5,
    mapping = aes(fill = asset),
    bins = bins_fd(asset_returns_dplyr[["returns"]])
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~asset) +
  ggtitle("Distributions of Monthly Log Returns") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey97"),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
  )
```
