&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the previous [post](https://www.kenwuyang.com/post/customizable-portfolio-dashboard/), we created a customizable portfolio dashboard via shiny. In that application, the weights of the portfolio are taken as given, and we focus more on the various types of visualizations and performance metrics. In this post, we create a portfolio optimization dashboard, which seeks to find the optimal set of weights that provide a set of optimal portfolios that satisfies some criteria. We will introduce some portfolio theory and seek to implement it in R using the `PortfolioAnalytics` and `tidyquant` packages. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more readings on the theory, I recommend [Essentials of Investments](https://www.amazon.com/ISE-Essentials-Investments-Zvi-Bodie/dp/1260288390/) and [Practical Portfolio Performance Measurement and Attribution](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Portfolio-Performance-Measurement-Attribution/dp/0470059281/). For implementing these theories in R, I suggest reading the documentations for the aforementioned R packages. Finally, the dashboard can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/yangwu1227/personal_project).
