&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this post, we will explore some finance topics---- portfolio allocation and portfolio returns. We want to focus on implementing portfolio theory in R. We will be using functions from several R packages--- `xts`, `tidyquant`, `tidyverse`. For more readings on the theory, I recommend [Essentials of Investments](https://www.amazon.com/ISE-Essentials-Investments-Zvi-Bodie/dp/1260288390/) and [Practical Portfolio Performance Measurement and Attribution](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Portfolio-Performance-Measurement-Attribution/dp/0470059281/).

## Optimal Weights for the five-asset portfolio (Minimum Variance)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We employ Markowitz's Mean-Variance model as the framework for computing optimal weights, essentially treating this as an "unconstrained" problem. The objective of this optimization problem is one of minimization:

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize}\hspace{2mm}(\sigma^{2}=\vec{W}^{T}\sum\vec{W}))
\end{align*}

subject to the sum of weights constraint and the box constraint:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} W_{i}=1 \quad \text { and } \hspace{3mm} \varepsilon_{i} \leq W_{i} \leq \delta_{i}
$$
where 

* where $\varepsilon_{i}=0.05 \hspace{3mm} \delta_{i}=0.6$ are the lower and upper bounds for the weights $W_{i}$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minimization problem is a quadratic problem with linear constraints, since the variance formula is a quadratic function and the constraints are linear functions; this type of problem is well suited to be solved using a quadratic programming solver. The `PortfolioAnalytics` package uses `ROI.plugin.quadprog`, a plug-in for the "R" Optimization Infrastructure, to solve the problem. The solver can be specified with the optimize_method argument in `optimize.portfolio()`. If optimize_method = "ROI" is specified, a default solver will be selected based on the optimization problem. The `glpk` solver is the default solver for LP and MILP optimization problems. The
`quadprog` solver is the default solver for QP optimization problems.

### Implementation in R

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Create a vector of ticker symbols
symbols <- c("SPY", "EFA", "IJS", "EEM", "AGG")
# Load data from 2012 to today
prices <- quantmod::getSymbols(
  Symbols = symbols,
  src = "yahoo",
  from = "2012-12-31",
  to = "2021-7-31",
  auto.assign = TRUE,
  warnings = FALSE
) %>%
  # The map function takes an anonymous function and will return a list of five
  purrr::map(.f = ~ quantmod::Ad(get(x = .x))) %>%
  # Use reduce() to merge the elements of .x consecutively
  #
  purrr::reduce(.f = merge) %>%
  # Use a replacement function to set column names as ticker symbols
  # This function is in prefix form
  # It is equivalent to colnames(x = prices) <- value
  `colnames<-`(value = symbols)
# Keep only the last reading of each month
asset_returns_xts <- xts::to.monthly(
  x = prices,
  drop.time = TRUE,
  indexAt = "lastof",
  OHLC = FALSE
) %>%
  # Compute simple returns
  # Log returns are time-additive but not portfolio additive
  PerformanceAnalytics::Return.calculate(method = "discrete") %>%
  # Drop the first row since we lose 12/31/2012
  stats::na.omit()
# Keep only the xts returns and prices series
rm(list = ls(!asset_returns_xts))
```

* Create Portfolio object

```{r}
# Examine the monthly simple returns for our five ETF's
head(x = asset_returns_xts, 5)
# Create Portfolio object which is a R list object
min_var_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::portfolio.spec(assets = symbols)
typeof(min_var_portfolio)
```

* Add constraints to the portfolio object

```{r}
# Add the full investment constraint that specifies the weights must sum to 1
min_var_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::add.constraint(
  portfolio = min_var_portfolio,
  type = "full_investment"
)
# Examine the constraint element by extracting min_var_portfolio[["constraints"]][[1]]
str(pluck(.x = min_var_portfolio, "constraints", 1))
# Add the box constraint that ensure the weights are between 0.1 and 0.6
min_var_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::add.constraint(
  portfolio = min_var_portfolio,
  type = "box", min = 0.05, max = 0.6
)
# Examine the constraint element by extracting min_var_portfolio[["constraints"]][[2]]
str(pluck(.x = min_var_portfolio, "constraints", 2))
```

* Add objective function

```{r}
# Add objective to minimize variance
min_var_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::add.objective(
  portfolio = min_var_portfolio,
  # Minimize risk
  type = "risk",
  # A character corresponding to a function name, var()
  name = "var"
)
```

* Optimization

```{r}
# Run the optimization
global_min_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::optimize.portfolio(
  R = asset_returns_xts,
  portfolio = min_var_portfolio,
  # This defaults to the "quadprog" solver
  optimize_method = "quadprog",
  # Return additional information on the path or portfolios searched
  trace = TRUE
)
# Examine returned portfolio list object
global_min_portfolio
```

## Optimal Weights for the five-asset portfolio (Maximum Expected Return)

The objective may also be one of maximization:

\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize}\hspace{2mm}(\vec{\mu}^{T}\vec{W})
\end{align*}

subject to the sum of weights constraint and the box constraint:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} W_{i}=1 \quad \text { and } \hspace{3mm} \varepsilon_{i} \leq W_{i} \leq \delta_{i}
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The optimization in this case is a linear programming problem, since the portfolio expected return formula is a linear function. This is best tackled using a linear programming solver. The package `PortfolioAnalytics` uses the ROI package with the `glpk plugin`, the GNU Linear Programming toolkit of R's Optimization Infrastructure.

### Implementation in R

* Create portfolio object

```{r}
# Create Portfolio object
max_exp_return_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::portfolio.spec(assets = symbols)
```

* Add constraints to the object

```{r}
# Add the full investment constraint that specifies the weights must sum to 1
max_exp_return_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::add.constraint(
  portfolio = max_exp_return_portfolio,
  type = "full_investment"
)
# Add the box constraint that ensure the weights are between 0.1 and 0.6
max_exp_return_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::add.constraint(
  portfolio = max_exp_return_portfolio,
  type = "box", min = 0.05, max = 0.6
)
```

* Add objective function 

```{r}
# Add objective to maximize mean returns
max_exp_return_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::add.objective(
  portfolio = max_exp_return_portfolio,
  # Maximize expected returns
  type = "return",
  # A character corresponding to a function name, mean()
  name = "mean"
)
```

* Optimization

```{r}
# Run the optimization
global_max_portfolio <- PortfolioAnalytics::optimize.portfolio(
  R = asset_returns_xts,
  portfolio = max_exp_return_portfolio,
  # This defaults to the "glpk" solver
  optimize_method = "glpk",
  # Return additional information on the path or portfolios searched
  trace = TRUE
)
# Examine returned portfolio list object
global_max_portfolio
```

---

## Building a portfolio

```{r}
# Set optimal weights
weights <- pluck(.x = global_max_portfolio, "weights")
# Check if the weights and symbols align
tibble(weights, symbols)
# Ensure that the weights vector sums up to 1
tibble(weights, symbols) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(total_weight = sum(weights))
```

The portfolio return in month, $t$, is given by:

\begin{align*}
r_{\text{portfolio,t}}=\sum_{i=1}^{5}W_{i}r^{cc}_{i,t}
\end{align*}

### Monthly portfolio returns by hand

```{r}
# Compute by hand
portfolio_returns_by_hand <-
  (weights[[1]] * asset_returns_xts[, 1]) +
  (weights[[2]] * asset_returns_xts[, 2]) +
  (weights[[3]] * asset_returns_xts[, 3]) +
  (weights[[4]] * asset_returns_xts[, 4]) +
  (weights[[5]] * asset_returns_xts[, 5])
# Name the series
portfolio_returns_by_hand <- `names<-`(portfolio_returns_by_hand, "Monthly portfolio returns")
# Examine
head(portfolio_returns_by_hand, 5)
```

---

### Monthly portfolio returns in xts

Note that re-balancing the weights every month is unrealistic; in reality, we could choose annual overbalancing. For this case study, however, we will re-balance monthly to be consistent with our brute force computation.  

```{r}
# Compute monthly portfolio returns
portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_monthly <-
  PerformanceAnalytics::Return.portfolio(
    R = asset_returns_xts,
    weights = weights,
    # Monthly re-balancing
    reblance_on = "months",
    # Use simple/arithmetic chaining to aggregate returns
    geometric = FALSE
  ) %>%
  `colnames<-`("Monthly_portfolio_returns")
# Examine
head(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_monthly, 5)
```

* The function `Return.portfolio(R, weights = NULL, wealth.index = FALSE, contribution = FALSE, geometric = TRUE, rebalance_on = c(NA, "years", "quarters", "months", "weeks", "days"), value = 1, verbose = FALSE, ...)` calculates the returns of a portfolio with the same periodicity of the returns data.

### Monthly portfolio returns in the tidyverse

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Convert from xts object to tibble
asset_returns_long <- xts::to.monthly(
  x = prices,
  drop.time = TRUE,
  indexAt = "lastof",
  OHLC = FALSE
) %>%
  # Create a new "date" variable by extracting the date indices from the xts object
  base::data.frame("date" = zoo::index(x = .)) %>%
  # Coerce to tibble
  dplyr::as_tibble() %>%
  # Create a key column "asset" that contains the column names, i.e. ticker symbols
  # Create a value column that contains all the cells associated with each column
  # We convert to long format since it is easier to compute the returns using lag()
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = 1:5,
    names_to = "asset",
    values_to = "returns"
  ) %>%
  # Group by ticker symbol
  dplyr::group_by(asset) %>%
  # Compute simple returns manually
  # Log returns are time-additive but not portfolio additive
  dplyr::mutate(
    "returns" = (
      (returns - dplyr::lag(x = returns)) / (dplyr::lag(x = returns))
    )
  ) %>%
  # Remove NA_double_ readings for 12/31/2021
  na.omit()
```

```{r}
# User vectorize if else statements to assign weights according to the asset column
potfolio_returns_dplyr_byhand <- asset_returns_long %>%
  group_by(asset) %>%
  mutate(
    weights = dplyr::case_when(
      asset == symbols[[1]] ~ weights[[1]],
      asset == symbols[[2]] ~ weights[[2]],
      asset == symbols[[3]] ~ weights[[3]],
      asset == symbols[[4]] ~ weights[[4]],
      asset == symbols[[5]] ~ weights[[5]]
    ),
    weighted_returns = weights * returns
  ) %>%
  # Group by date
  # We need to group by date so that the aggregate sum() function is carried out by month
  # For each date, the original series has 5 weighted returns, one for each ETF
  # The results should be 1 portfolio return (the sum of the 5 weighted returns) for each month
  group_by(date) %>%
  # Compute monthly portfolio returns
  dplyr::summarize(Monthly_portfolio_returns = sum(weighted_returns))
# Examine
head(potfolio_returns_dplyr_byhand, 5)
```

* The function `summarize(.data, ..., .groups = NULL)` creates a new data frame. It will have one (or more) rows for each combination of grouping variables.

### Monthly portfolio returns in tidyquant 

**\underline{Method 1}**

```{r}
# Use tibble from the tidyverse but function from tidyquant
portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_monthly_method_1 <- asset_returns_long %>%
  tidyquant::tq_portfolio(
    assets_col = asset,
    returns_col = returns,
    weights = weights,
    col_rename = "Monthly_portfolio_returns",
    rebalance_on = "months"
  )
# Examine
head(portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_monthly_method_1, 5)
```

* The function `check_weights(weights)` from the `LDATS` package checks that the vector of document weights is numeric and positive and inform the user if the average weight isn't 1.

* The function `tq_portfolio(data, assets_col, returns_col, weights = NULL, col_rename = NULL, ...)` aggregates a group of returns by asset into portfolio returns.
  
---

**\underline{Method 2}**

An alternative way to load data is to using `tidquant` wrapper function, which automatically coerces the returns into a long tidy format:

```{r}
# Load data
asset_returns_tq <- tidyquant::tq_get(
  x = symbols,
  get = "stock.prices",
  from = "2012-12-31",
  to = "2021-7-31",
) %>%
  # The asset column is named symbol by default (see body(tidyquant::tq_get))
  dplyr::group_by(symbol) %>%
  tidyquant::tq_transmute(
    select = adjusted,
    col_rename = "returns",
    # This function is from quantmod
    mutate_fun = periodReturn,
    # These are argument are passed along to the mutate function quantmod::periodReturn
    period = "monthly",
    type = "arithmetic",
    leading = FALSE,
    # This argument is passed along to xts::to.period, which is wrapped by quantmod::periodReturn
    indexAt = "lastof"
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(asset = symbol) %>% 
  na.omit()
```

* The function `tq_get(x, get = "stock.prices", complete_cases = TRUE, ...)` gets data in tibble format. The most important argument is perhaps the dot-dot-dot, since these are the argument passed to the underlying functions that `tq_get()` uses. There could be multiple layers of wrapper functions and so read the documentations carefully.

A possibly more useful method of aggregating asset returns to portfolio returns then is to use a tibble of symbols and weights that are mapped to the portfolio:

```{r}
# Create a tibble of weights
weights_tibble <- tibble(
    asset = symbols,
    weights = weights
)
# Map the weights to the returns column using the asset column as the identifier
portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_monthly_method_2 <- asset_returns_tq %>% 
tidyquant::tq_portfolio(
  assets_col = asset,
  returns_col = returns,
  weights = weights_tibble,
  col_rename = "Monthly_portfolio_returns",
  rebalance_on = "months"
)
```

---

### Compare and Contrast these four methods

```{r}
four_computational_methods <- potfolio_returns_dplyr_byhand %>%
  # Rename the column
  rename(tidyverse_method = Monthly_portfolio_returns) %>%
  # Create three new columns that contain results for other methods
  dplyr::mutate(
    equation_byhand = zoo::coredata(x = portfolio_returns_by_hand),
    tq_method_1 = portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_monthly_method_1[["Monthly_portfolio_returns"]],
    tq_method_2 = portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_monthly_method_2[["Monthly_portfolio_returns"]],
    xts_method = zoo::coredata(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_monthly)
  ) %>%
  purrr::modify_if(.p = is.numeric, .f = ~ round(x = .x, digits = 7))
# Examine
head(four_computational_methods, 10)
```

* The function `coredata(x, ...)` is a generic function for extracting the core data contained in, a (more complex) object and replacing it. The replacement function is `coredata<-`.
