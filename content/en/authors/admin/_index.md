Hello! Welcome to my personal site! I am a recent graduate of Kenyon College, where I studied Economics and Statistics. I am passionate about economics, applied statistics, programming, data science and wish to explore a career in industries and fields that derive value from quantitative analysis and insights. I am a curious individual who is always seeking to learning new things. I have a strong desire to bring value to others and be helpful in every situation I am in. You can find most if not all of my projects in my github [repositories](https://github.com/YangWu1227).
