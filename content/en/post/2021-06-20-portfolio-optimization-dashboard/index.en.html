<p>       In the previous <a href="https://www.kenwuyang.com/en/post/customizable-portfolio-dashboard/">post</a>, we created a customizable portfolio dashboard via R shiny. In that application, the weights of the portfolio are taken as given, and we focus more on the various types of visualizations and performance metrics. In this post, we create a portfolio optimization dashboard, which seeks to find the optimal set of weights, subject to some constraints, that yields a set of optimal portfolios. We will introduce some portfolio theory and implement the theoretical framework in R using packages such as <code>PortfolioAnalytics</code>, <code>PerformanceAnalytics</code>, and <code>tidyquant</code>.</p>
<p>       For more readings on the theory, I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ISE-Essentials-Investments-Zvi-Bodie/dp/1260288390/">Essentials of Investments</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Portfolio-Performance-Measurement-Attribution/dp/0470059281/">Practical Portfolio Performance Measurement and Attribution</a>. For implementing these theories in R, I suggest reading the documentations for the aforementioned R packages; in addition, Matt Dancho from <a href="https://university.business-science.io/">Business Science University</a> (he is also the co-author of the <code>tidyquant</code> package) provides some very useful <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/index.html">vignettes</a> on the <code>tidyquant</code> package. Many of my posts are inspired by his incredibly practical learning labs and vignettes. Finally, the dashboard can be found <a href="https://rpubs.com/yangwu1227/personal_project">here</a>.</p>
