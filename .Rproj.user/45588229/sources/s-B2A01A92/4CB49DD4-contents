&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This scenario-based project was given to us as an assignment in my [linear regression model class](https://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-and-majors/mathematics-statistics/academic-program-requirements/courses-in-statistics/). 
A university medical center had data on several variables of interest relating to prostate cancer patients. The general assignment was to develop a model that uses the variables (or an
appropriate subset thereof) in the data set provided to us in order to describe and predict the main variable of interest--- prostate-specific antigen levels. There were needs for analysis in the following areas: 

1. Univariate analysis of the variables of interests in the data set.
2. Thorough assessment of how well the multiple regression model fits the data and provide justifications for why a model is selected over another.
3. Provide interval estimates for important model coefficients, and interpret them. Need a
family confidence of 95%.
4. Perform appropriate diagnostics such as residual analysis, assumptions validation, etc.
