      <guid>https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/modeling-prostate-specific-antigen-levels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;       This scenario-based project was given to us as an assignment in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-and-majors/mathematics-statistics/academic-program-requirements/courses-in-statistics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;linear regression model class&lt;/a&gt;.
A university medical center had data on several variables of interest relating to prostate cancer patients. The general assignment was to develop a model that uses the variables (or an
appropriate subset thereof) in the data set provided to us in order to describe and predict the main variable of interest&amp;mdash; prostate-specific antigen levels. There were needs for analysis in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Univariate analysis of the variables of interests in the data set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough assessment of how well the multiple regression model fits the data and provide justifications for why a model is selected over another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide interval estimates for important model coefficients, and interpret them. Need a
family confidence of 95%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform appropriate diagnostics such as residual analysis, assumptions validation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finished report can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/Modeling%20Prostate-Specific%20Antigen%20Levels/Yang_Wu_Writing_Sample.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; for those interested, here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/Modeling%20Prostate-Specific%20Antigen%20Levels/yang_wu_prostate_data.csv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A production planning supervisor for a lumber company has hired us to help with developing a predictive model. The lumber company wishes to use the diameter of a tree to predict the volume of lumber obtained from the tree after processing. A successful model will help the planning supervisor schedule tree-cutting and mill processing. There were needs for analysis in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a mathematical model, or two, to predict lumber volume from tree diameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assess how well the model(s) fits the data. Perform appropriate diagnostics such as residual analysis, assumptions validation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide some useful confidence intervals to help aid the decision-making process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a rough gauge of average production for small, medium, and large trees. Use confidence intervals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate the total lumber volume of a single pallet of sixteen trees.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;central-limit-theorem&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central Limit Theorem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central limit theorem, crudely speaking, states that— if there is a distriubtion with expected value given by the mean &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt; and finite variance &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\sigma^2\)&lt;/span&gt; and we take &lt;em&gt;sufficiently&lt;/em&gt; large random samples from this distribution with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be &lt;em&gt;approximately&lt;/em&gt; normally distributed. This will hold true regardless of whether the source or “parent” distribution is normal, conditional on the fact that the sample size is sufficiently large (say, n &amp;gt; 30). Below we demonstrate two characteristics of the CLT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mean of the distribution of sample means, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\)&lt;/span&gt; should converge towards the mean of the “parent population,” the population from which the random samples are drawn, as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n \to \infty\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard deviation of the distribution of sample means, also known as the standard error of the mean, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, should become smaller as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n \to \infty\)&lt;/span&gt;. In other words, the spread of the distribution of sample means should decrease as sample size, n, increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we examine a poisson distribution &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\sim pois(220/24)\)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Lambda is the number of geese that arrive per hour
lambda &amp;lt;- 220 / 24
# Number of random samples to be drawn
numsim &amp;lt;- 10000
# Initialize variables
mean5 &amp;lt;- rep(0, numsim)
mean15 &amp;lt;- rep(0, numsim)
mean30 &amp;lt;- rep(0, numsim)
mean100 &amp;lt;- rep(0, numsim)
mean200 &amp;lt;- rep(0, numsim)
# Loop for simulating
for (i in 1:numsim) {

  # sample means
  mean5[i] &amp;lt;- mean(rpois(5, lambda))
  mean15[i] &amp;lt;- mean(rpois(15, lambda))
  mean30[i] &amp;lt;- mean(rpois(30, lambda))
  mean100[i] &amp;lt;- mean(rpois(100, lambda))
  mean200[i] &amp;lt;- mean(rpois(200, lambda))
}
# Create five data frames for these sampling distributions with varying sample sizes
# Create a variable &amp;quot;sample_size&amp;quot; used as an identifier
n_5 &amp;lt;- data.frame(sample_size = as.factor(rep(5, 10000)), sample_means = mean5)
n_15 &amp;lt;- data.frame(sample_size = as.factor(rep(15, 10000)), sample_means = mean15)
n_30 &amp;lt;- data.frame(sample_size = as.factor(rep(30, 10000)), sample_means = mean30)
n_100 &amp;lt;- data.frame(sample_size = as.factor(rep(100, 10000)), sample_means = mean100)
n_200 &amp;lt;- data.frame(sample_size = as.factor(rep(200, 10000)), sample_means = mean200)
# Combine into a single data frame
# rbind() combines data frames by rows
sampling_distributions &amp;lt;- rbind(n_5, n_15, n_30, n_100, n_200)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first characteristic of the CLT states that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\)&lt;/span&gt; should converge towards &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\lambda= 9.1667\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n \to \infty\)&lt;/span&gt;. Let’s check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Using tapply
round(tapply(
  sampling_distributions$sample_means,
  sampling_distributions$sample_size, mean
), digits = 5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      5      15      30     100     200 
9.15432 9.17101 9.16610 9.17031 9.16850 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\)&lt;/span&gt; gets closer and closer to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\lambda= 9.1667\)&lt;/span&gt; as sample size becomes larger. For the second characteristic, let’s examine the overlay density plots of these sampling distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Using ggplot()
p &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = sampling_distributions, aes(x = sample_means))
p &amp;lt;- p + geom_density(aes(fill = sample_size, color = sample_size), alpha = 0.2)
p &amp;lt;- p + geom_vline(xintercept = lambda, linetype = &amp;quot;dashed&amp;quot;)
p &amp;lt;- p + ggtitle(&amp;quot;Density Plot of Sampling Distributions&amp;quot;)
p &amp;lt;- p + xlab(&amp;quot;Distributions of Sample Means&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Density&amp;quot;)
p &amp;lt;- p + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;azure2&amp;quot;))
p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/central-limit-theorem-and-power-simulation/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashed line in the figure above indicates &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\lambda= 9.1667\)&lt;/span&gt;. Evidently, as sample size gets larger, the spread of the distribution of sample means gets smaller. We have a visual confirmation of the CTL that standard error of the mean should become smaller as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n \to \infty\)&lt;/span&gt;. Below, we compute the standard deviations of these distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Using tapply
round(tapply(sampling_distributions$sample_means, sampling_distributions$sample_size, sd), digits = 5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      5      15      30     100     200 
1.34549 0.77477 0.54653 0.29724 0.21252 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have a numeric proof of this characteristic as well. Additionally, we may also compare these simulated values to our analytical solutions. We know that the standard deviation of a poisson distribution is simply the square root of the mean, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\lambda\)&lt;/span&gt;. Before we run any simulations, we may compute the standard errors of the mean, given a sample size, n, analytically, using the formula: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# sd of the distribution of a random sample n=5
sd_5 &amp;lt;- sqrt(lambda) / sqrt(5)
# sd of the distribution of a random sample n=15
sd_15 &amp;lt;- sqrt(lambda) / sqrt(15)
# sd of the distribution of a random sample n=30
sd_30 &amp;lt;- sqrt(lambda) / sqrt(30)
# sd of the distribution of a random sample n=100
sd_100 &amp;lt;- sqrt(lambda) / sqrt(100)
# sd of the distribution of a random sample n=200
sd_200 &amp;lt;- sqrt(lambda) / sqrt(200)
# store in one vector
se &amp;lt;- c(sd_5, sd_15, sd_30, sd_100, sd_200)
names(se) &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;5&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;15&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;30&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;200&amp;quot;)
se&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        5        15        30       100       200 
1.3540064 0.7817360 0.5527708 0.3027650 0.2140872 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we see that our simulated values match pretty well with our analytical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;multivariate-normal-distribution&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multivariate Normal Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two random variables &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X_{1}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X_{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; have a bivariate normal distribution, we can express them using matrix notations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A random &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2 \times 1\)&lt;/span&gt; column vector X and its mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
X &amp;amp;= \begin{pmatrix} X_{1}\\ X_{2} \end{pmatrix} \\
\mu &amp;amp;= \begin{pmatrix} \mu_{X_{1}}\\ \mu_{X_{2}} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2 \times 2\)&lt;/span&gt; covariance matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\sum &amp;amp;= \begin{pmatrix} Var_{X_{1}} &amp;amp; Cov_{X_{2}X_{1}}\\ Cov_{X_{1}X_{2}} &amp;amp; Var_{X_{2}} \end{pmatrix} \\
     &amp;amp;= \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2_{X_{1}} &amp;amp; \rho\cdot\sigma_{X_{2}}\cdot\sigma_{X_{1}} \\ \rho\cdot \sigma_{X_{1}}\cdot\sigma_{X_{2}} &amp;amp; \sigma^2_{X_{2}} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we say &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X \sim N(\mu,\sum)\)&lt;/span&gt;. From Horton’s code, we have the following user-defined function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Define a function for genearting random multivariate normals
rmultnorm &amp;lt;- function(n, mu, vmat, tol = 1e-07) {
  p &amp;lt;- ncol(vmat)
  if (length(mu) != p) {
    stop(&amp;quot;alright, alright, alright, mu vector is the wrong length&amp;quot;)
  }
  if (max(abs(vmat - t(vmat))) &amp;gt; tol) {
    stop(&amp;quot;vmat not symmetric&amp;quot;)
  }
  vs &amp;lt;- svd(vmat)
  vsqrt &amp;lt;- t(vs$v %*% (t(vs$u) * sqrt(vs$d)))
  ans &amp;lt;- matrix(rnorm(n * p), nrow = n) %*% vsqrt
  ans &amp;lt;- sweep(ans, 2, mu, &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;)
  dimnames(ans) &amp;lt;- list(NULL, dimnames(vmat)[[2]])
  return(ans)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a function for genearting random multivariate normals. If we would like simulate observations from a bivariate normal distribution with mean 100, variance 14, and &lt;em&gt;moderate&lt;/em&gt; negative association, and we use the Cohen (1988) convention for interpreting the strength of the correlation coefficient, we need to find &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X_{1}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X_{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; with a correlation coefficient, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\rho\)&lt;/span&gt;, of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\approx\)&lt;/span&gt; -0.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\frac{Cov_{X_{1}X_{2}}}{\sigma_{X_{1}}\sigma_{X_{2}}}&amp;amp;=-0.3\\
Cov_{X_{1}X_{2}}&amp;amp;=\sigma_{X_{1}}\sigma_{X_{2}}\cdot(-0.3)\\
Cov_{X_{1}X_{2}}&amp;amp;=-0.3\sqrt{14}\sqrt{14}\\
Cov_{X_{1}X_{2}}&amp;amp;\approx-4.2
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We modify the inputs of the function defined above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Sample size

set.seed(12)

&lt;p&gt;Here is a scatter plot on the xy-plane:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, when &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\rho\)&lt;/span&gt; is negative, the bell-shaped surface becomes flattened on a negative sloping line extending out towards the top left and bottom right corners. So for &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\rho \approx -0.29\)&lt;/span&gt;, X1 varies negatively with X2 (X2 is denoted as Y in the figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate observations from a bivariate normal distribution with a &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; negative association, say, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\rho = -0.8\)&lt;/span&gt;, we again modify the inputs to the function we defined in the begining. Here are the scatter plot and the plot of their joint probability function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Simulating Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a variety of perspectives on the definition of power. Simply put, power is the probability of avoiding a Type II error, according to Neil Weiss in Introductory Statistics. In the section below we explore the concept of power by examining a two-way ANOVA with interaction. Note that for simplicity, I used arbitrarily picked values for the model instead of real empirical data. In the context of a two-way ANOVA with interaction, we could interpret power as &lt;em&gt;the probability that a test of significance will pick up on an effect that is present&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Define a function for a two-way anova model with interaction
two_way_anova_interaction_regression &amp;lt;- function(n, b0, b1, b2, b3,
                                                 x1_mean = 0, x1_sd = 1, err_mean = 0, err_sd = 1) {

  # x1 draws n values from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 &amp;amp; sd of 1
  # x2 draws integers btw 0 to 1, n times (i.e., n numbers of either 0 or 1)
  x1 &amp;lt;- rnorm(n, mean = x1_mean, sd = x1_sd)
  x2 &amp;lt;- sample(0:1, n, replace = TRUE)

  # y is a linear combination of x1 &amp;amp; x2 multiplied by coefficients/effect sizes
  # the last term is the error term-- i.e. the unexplained portion of y
  y &amp;lt;- b0 + (b1 * x1) + (b2 * x2) + (b3 * x1 * x2) + rnorm(n, mean = err_mean, sd = err_sd)

  # regression model
  anova_model &amp;lt;- lm(y ~ x1 * x2)
  summary(anova_model)

  # store model outputs
  output &amp;lt;- summary(anova_model)$coefficients
  coeffs &amp;lt;- output[, 1]
  p_values &amp;lt;- output[, 4]
  r_sqr &amp;lt;- summary(anova_model)$r.squared

  # output
  results &amp;lt;- c(coeffs, p_values, r_sqr)
  names(results) &amp;lt;- c(
    &amp;quot;$\\beta_{0}$&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;$\\beta_{1}$&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;$\\beta_{2}$&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;$\\beta_{3}$&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;$\\beta_{0}$_pvalue&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;$\\beta_{1}$_pvalue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;$\\beta_{2}$_pvalue&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;$\\beta_{3}$_pvalue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;$r^2$&amp;quot;
  )
  return(results)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try using this function :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Using arbitrarily picked values

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we run 1000 simulations of the model, finding the coefficients and their associating p-values for each iteration. The output would be a data frame, with one row per simulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Number of simulations

# ldply () applies function for each element of a list then combine results into a data frame.

&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.7472213&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can estimate power by finding the proportion of p-values that are significant. We are primarily interested in the p-value for the interaction effect, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_{3}\)&lt;/span&gt;. We use a logical expression to find out whether the p-values of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_{3}\)&lt;/span&gt; is less than .05. This would return a logical vector of TRUEs and FALSEs. We then sum this vector (TRUE gets counted as 1 &amp;amp; FALSE as 0). Finally, we divide this value by the total number of simulations, 1000, to get the proportion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Estimating Power
power &amp;lt;- sum(power_simulations[[8]] &amp;lt; .05) / nrow(power_simulations)
cat(power)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.67&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could tweak the parameters to see how it affects our power estimate. For instance, we could investigate what happens when we increase sample sizes for x1 and x2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Create a vector of sample sizes ranging from 50 to 500
sample_sizes &amp;lt;- c(50, 100, 200, 300, 500)
# Initualize variable
results &amp;lt;- list()
# For Loop
for (val in sample_sizes) {

  # cycle through each value in &amp;quot;sample_sizes&amp;quot; and sets val to be that value
  # then pass that value to the simulation function as the sample size n
  power_simulations &amp;lt;- ldply(1:1000, two_way_anova_interaction_regression,
    n = val, b0 = 0, b1 = 0.3, b2 = 0.2, b3 = 0.3
  )

  # create new variable called n in the output data frame &amp;quot;results&amp;quot;
  # this variable functions as an indentifier
  power_simulations$n &amp;lt;- as.factor(val)


  # rbind() combines data frames by rows
  # notice that the first argument &amp;quot;results&amp;quot; in rbind() is an empty list when val=50
  # after each cycle, this dataframe gets 1000 more rows added to it
  # in the end we should have a single data frame with 5000 rows as there are five values in &amp;quot;sample_sizes&amp;quot;
  results &amp;lt;- rbind(results, power_simulations)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could examine the results using a table and a plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Split results into five individual data frames using the variable &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; as the identifier
list_of_results &amp;lt;- split(results, results[[10]])
# Find the power estimates associated with each sample size
power_n_50 &amp;lt;- sum(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;50&amp;quot;]][[8]] &amp;lt; .05) / nrow(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;50&amp;quot;]])
power_n_100 &amp;lt;- sum(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;]][[8]] &amp;lt; .05) / nrow(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;]])
power_n_200 &amp;lt;- sum(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;200&amp;quot;]][[8]] &amp;lt; .05) / nrow(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;200&amp;quot;]])
power_n_300 &amp;lt;- sum(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]][[8]] &amp;lt; .05) / nrow(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]])
power_n_500 &amp;lt;- sum(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;500&amp;quot;]][[8]] &amp;lt; .05) / nrow(list_of_results[[&amp;quot;500&amp;quot;]])
# Store all power estimates in one single vector
power_estimates &amp;lt;- c(power_n_50, power_n_100, power_n_200, power_n_300, power_n_500)
# Create data frame
power_table &amp;lt;- data.frame(
  &amp;quot;Sample Size&amp;quot; = sample_sizes,
  &amp;quot;Power Estimate&amp;quot; = power_estimates
)
# Generate table using kable () function from the knitr package
knitr::kable(power_table, caption = &amp;quot;Power Estimates by Sample Size&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;tab:unnamed-chunk-18&#34;&gt;Table 3: &lt;/span&gt;Power Estimates by Sample Size&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;

&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Power.Estimate&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.728&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.910&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Using ggplot()
p &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = power_table, aes(x = Sample.Size, y = Power.Estimate))
p &amp;lt;- p + geom_point(color = &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;)
p &amp;lt;- p + geom_line(color = &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;)
p &amp;lt;- p + geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8, linetype = &amp;quot;dashed&amp;quot;)
p &amp;lt;- p + ylim(c(0, 1))
p &amp;lt;- p + ggtitle(&amp;quot;Power Estimates by Sample Size&amp;quot;) + xlab(&amp;quot;Sample Size&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Power Estimates&amp;quot;)
p &amp;lt;- p + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;azure2&amp;quot;))
p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/central-limit-theorem-and-power-simulation/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, our power estimates increase as sample size increases. If we take 0.8 as the rough rule of thumb of desired level of power, then a sample size of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\approx350\)&lt;/span&gt; would yield us that level of power given the set of parameters I chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/implementing-math-concepts-in-r/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will be implementing some interesting mathematical objects in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? You say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? It’s a good way to practice solving narrow problems in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-binomial-theorem&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Binomial Theorem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
    (x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}x^{k}y^{n-k}
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
    (x+y)^n=\binom{n}{0}x^{0}y^{n-0}+\binom{n}{1}x^{1}y^{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}x^{2}y^{n-2}+...+\binom{n}{n-1}x^{n-1}y^{n-(n-1)}+\binom{n}{n}x^{n}y^{n-n}
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In R, we can tackle the implementation of the Binomial Theorem in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the binomial coefficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raising the real number &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; to the vector of powers &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raising the real number &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; to the vector of powers &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n-k\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;binomial_theorem &amp;lt;- function(x, y, n) {

  # Create a sequence from k = 0 to k = n
  seq_k_n &amp;lt;- seq.int(from = 0, to = n, by = 1)


  # Pre-allocate container for storing coefficients
  binom_coeffs &amp;lt;- vector(mode = &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;, length = n + 1)
  # Binomial coefficients
  binom_coeffs &amp;lt;- purrr::map_dbl(.x = seq_k_n, .f = choose, n = n)


  # Pre-allocate container for storing the x&amp;#39;s
  vector_of_x &amp;lt;- vector(mode = &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;, length = n + 1)
  # Raise x to the power of y
  vector_of_x &amp;lt;- x^(seq_k_n)


  # Pre-allocate container for storing the y&amp;#39;s
  vector_of_y &amp;lt;- vector(mode = &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;, length = n + 1)
  # Raise y to the power of n-k
  vector_of_y &amp;lt;- y^(n - (seq_k_n))


  # Product of the two vectors and their coefficients
  prod &amp;lt;- binom_coeffs * vector_of_x * vector_of_y

  # Summation operator
  result &amp;lt;- sum(prod)
  result
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Test
x &amp;lt;- 924
y &amp;lt;- 23
n &amp;lt;- 39
# Compute by hand
(x + y)^n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 1.195774e+116&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Compute using custom function
binomial_theorem(x = x, y = y, n = n)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 1.195774e+116&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, the results are exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;pascals-triangle&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pascal’s Triangle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly related to the Binomial coefficient is Pascal’s triangle, whose entries in each row are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Import image
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;Pascal&amp;#39;s Triangle.png&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:block;&#34; id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Pascal&#39;s Triangle.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pascal&#39;s Triangle Explanation.&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Pascal’s Triangle Explanation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement Pascal’s triangle, we will use a for loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Finding the (n + 1)th row of a Pascal&amp;#39;s triangle given n rows that precede it
pascal_triangle_n_plus_1 &amp;lt;- function(x) {
  if (!is.list(x)) {
    rlang::abort(message = &amp;quot;The input object must a be a list containing the rows of Pascal&amp;#39;s Triangle.&amp;quot;)
  }

  # Set n equal to depth of the input list &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;, that is, the number of elements in x, where each represents a row
  n &amp;lt;- length(x)
  # Extract the last element (the nth row) from the input list &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; and store it as a new variable x_n
  # Use [[ to extract the value rather than a sub-list
  x_n &amp;lt;- x[[n]]
  # Repeat the integer &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; (n + 1) times
  # Note that the (n + 1)th  row has (n + 1) elements beginning and ending with 1
  x_n_plus_1 &amp;lt;- rep(x = 1, times = n + 1)

  # Loop to add all adjacent pairs in the nth row to obtain the (n + 1)th row
  # Start with the second element and end with second to last element of each row
  # This is because the first and last numbers in any given row are always 1
  if (n &amp;gt; 1) {
    # This is the prefix form of for loop
    `for`(
      var = i,
      seq = 2:n,
      action = x_n_plus_1[[i]] &amp;lt;- x_n[[i - 1]] + x_n[[i]]
    )
  }

  # Append the (n + 1)th row to the list object
  base::append(x, values = list(x_n_plus_1))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Create a Pascal&amp;#39;s Triangle with 4 rows
x &amp;lt;- list(c(1), c(1, 1), c(1, 2, 1), c(1, 3, 3, 1))
